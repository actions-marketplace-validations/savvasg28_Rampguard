# Rampguard

Rampguard is a GitHub Action that advances a Google Play staged rollout one stage per scheduled run, and halts the
rollout when an alerting tool or a person asks. It needs one YAML file in your app repository and one secret. It runs
no server and keeps no state. It reports what it did as step outputs, so the steps after it in your workflow can tell
Slack, Sentry, Datadog or anything else.

This README is for the engineer who installs Rampguard in an Android app repository. It assumes you already upload
and submit releases through the Play Console or CI, and that your repository uses GitHub Actions.

> **Status: early.** Listed on the GitHub Marketplace as
> [Rampguard Play Rollout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/rampguard-play-rollout); `savvasg28/Rampguard@v1`
> resolves to the current release.

## Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **release** | A version on the Play production track, identified by its version codes. |
| **stage** | A rollout percentage from your `stages` list, for example 5%. |
| **step** | Moving the live release from its current stage to the next one. 100% completes the release. |
| **run** | One execution of the tick workflow: scheduled, or triggered by hand. |

## How it works

Each run reads the production track and does one of the following:

| The run sees | The run does |
|---|---|
| A release in progress at a stage | Steps it to the next stage. At the last stage, completes it. |
| A release in progress between two stages | Treats it as the lower stage and steps to the stage above. |
| A halted or completed release | Nothing. A person resumes a halted release in the Play Console. |
| A release waiting to be published, or rejected | Nothing, but reports it. |
| An unreadable Play API | Nothing, and fails the job. |

The cron expression is the schedule. `0 9 * * 1-5` steps every weekday morning: 1% on Monday becomes 5% on Tuesday,
20% on Wednesday, and so on. Weekends and freezes are whatever the cron does not cover.

Rampguard does not judge release health. Play vitals arrive days late and are too coarse to gate a rollout
([ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-scheduled-rollouts-with-external-brakes.md)). The decision to stop belongs to the tools you
already alert from; they tell Rampguard to halt.

## Install

1. Add the repository secret `PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: the JSON key of a Play service account that can see this app
   only, with *View app information* and *Release to production* permissions.
2. Copy [`examples/workflows/rollout-tick.yml`](examples/workflows/rollout-tick.yml) and
   [`examples/workflows/rollout-command.yml`](examples/workflows/rollout-command.yml) into `.github/workflows/`. Keep
   the notification steps you want and delete the rest; each needs its own secret.
3. In both workflow files, set the concurrency group to your package name.
4. Add `.github/rampguard.yml` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).
5. From the Actions tab, run the tick workflow once with **dry-run** selected, then read the job summary. The run
   reports what it would do and writes nothing.

From the next scheduled run on, Rampguard steps the live release.

To step before the schedule, run the tick workflow by hand without dry-run. To stop Rampguard entirely, disable the
tick workflow in the Actions tab.

## Configuration

`.github/rampguard.yml`:

```yaml
app: com.example.app
stages: [1, 5, 20, 50, 100]
```

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `app` | yes | The application package name. |
| `stages` | yes | Rollout percentages, strictly increasing, ending in 100. You set the first stage when you publish the release; Rampguard owns every stage after it. |

Unknown keys are rejected, so a typo fails the job before any API call.

Because a run steps whatever release is live, publish a new release after the morning run. A release published minutes
before the run gets its first step minutes later.

## Tell your tools

Rampguard writes what happened to the job log, the job summary and the step outputs. It sends nothing anywhere itself.
A step after it reads the outputs and calls the tool's own action:

```yaml
- id: rampguard
  uses: savvasg28/Rampguard@v1
  with:
    command: tick
    play-credentials: ${{ secrets.PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON }}

- if: steps.rampguard.outputs.event == 'advanced'
  uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v4
  with:
    webhook: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    webhook-type: incoming-webhook
    payload: |
      text: "${{ steps.rampguard.outputs.release-name }} is now at ${{ steps.rampguard.outputs.to-percent }}%"
```

| Output | Value |
|---|---|
| `event` | What this run did to the live release: `advanced`, `completed`, `halted`, `failed` or `none`. A dry run reports `none`. |
| `release-name`, `version-codes` | The live release. Version codes are comma-separated. |
| `from-percent`, `to-percent` | The step taken, on `advanced` and `completed`. |
| `reason`, `source` | Why and who, on `halted`. |
| `ready-to-publish` | A release that Play review approved and a person has to publish. Reported on every run that sees it. |
| `rejected` | A release that Play review rejected. |

Every output is always set, empty when it does not apply. The names are a contract: outputs are added, never renamed.
The example tick workflow has working steps for Slack, Sentry releases, Datadog events and Grafana annotations.

## Halt a rollout

Send a `repository_dispatch` event to the app repository:

```sh
curl -X POST https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/dispatches \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -d '{"event_type":"rollout-halt","client_payload":{"source":"sentry","reason":"crash spike","versionCode":101}}'
```

The command workflow halts the release in Play if `versionCode` belongs to the live release. A second halt, or a halt
for another version code, does nothing. A person can also halt from the Actions tab.

Anyone whose token can dispatch to the repository can halt the rollout. Use a fine-grained token per sender.
Resuming a halted release is a human decision in the Play Console.

Recipes for Datadog, Sentry, Crashlytics and the shell are in [`examples/halt/`](examples/halt/README.md).

## Release Rampguard

This section is for maintainers.

In the Actions tab, run the Release workflow with the version, for example `0.2.0`. It runs the checks, builds the
jar, pins the jar's SHA-256 in `action.yml`, commits that pin to `main`, moves the `v1` tag to the new commit, and
uploads the jar and its checksum to the single `v1` release. Installers always use `@v1`.

The action refuses to run a jar whose checksum does not match the pin.

## Run locally

You can run every command from a checkout without touching any workflow. Each command reads Play and, except for a
real `tick` or `halt`, writes nothing.

```sh
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/keys/play-service-account.json
bin/rampguard status --config ~/rampguard-myapp.yml
bin/rampguard tick --dry-run --config ~/rampguard-myapp.yml
```

`bin/rampguard` builds the launcher on first use. To install it elsewhere, run `./gradlew :cli:installDist` and copy
`cli/build/install/rampguard/`.

## Develop

```sh
./gradlew check                                                  # build, tests, lint, dependency rules, coverage gate
./gradlew ktlintFormat                                           # format before committing
./gradlew :cli:run --args="validate --config examples/rampguard.yml"
```
